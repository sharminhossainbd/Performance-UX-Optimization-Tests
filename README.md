# Performance & UX Optimization Tests

This repository outlines the results from a series of 10 tests conducted to enhance the platform's performance, user experience (UX), and operational processes. The objective of these tests was to evaluate the impact of specific changes on key metrics, such as user behavior, conversions, engagement, and operational efficiency. These findings provide actionable insights for improving various aspects of the platform, including customer satisfaction, sales performance, and system usability.

## Test 1: Request for Stock Button for Foreign Books
- Over a 15-day period, the "Not Available" status has decreased by 50% compared to the previous month.
- A total of 178 orders had been placed through the "Request for Stock" feature.
- No negative feedback has been received so far.

## Test 2: Minimal Header for Shipping & Payment Page (Mobile)
- The header for the Shipping and Payment pages was minimized for mobile devices only.
- Data from three days before and after the test shows a decrease in conversion from the Shipping page to the Payment page. Initially, this was thought to be due to a festival, but the conversion rates did not improve in the following weeks either.
- The conversion from the Payment page to the Invoice page remained neutral, with no significant changes observed.

## Test 3: Add Money to Wallet for New Verified Customers
- In April, an email was sent to 150 newly verified customers, adding 80 BDT to their wallets, with a 7-day validity period.
- Customers who did not place an order after the first email received a reminder two days before the expiration.
- A total of 10 orders were placed, with 4 customers using wallet payments.
- **Email Performance**:
  - Open vs Delivered Rate: 26.42%
  - Click vs Open Rate: 49.02%
  - Click vs Delivered Rate: 12.95%
  - Order vs Click Rate: 20%
- Total Orders: 10
- Total Revenue: 4,050 BDT

## Test 4: Increasing Delivery Charge
- Delivery charges were increased from 40 BDT to 50 BDT (online) and from 60 BDT to 80 BDT (phone) for an 8-day period.
- Despite a decrease in users during the test week compared to the weeks before and after, the order percentage was highest during the test.
- New orders decreased during the test week (down 3.09% compared to the previous week, and down 5.77% compared to the following week).
- The number of multiple product orders increased (up 2.44% compared to the previous week, and up 4.22% compared to the following week).

## Test 5: Front List Text in Bangla
- The text on the front list was changed to Bengali font, and data was analyzed over four weeks (two weeks before and after the test).
- Overall users decreased by 2%, but front list users increased by 11.35% after switching to Bengali.
- Overall unique pageviews decreased by 3%, but front list pageviews increased by 5.28%.
- No significant changes in conversion were observed.

## Test 6: Show Expected Delivery Date

- From 14 days of data, it's observed that since the introduction of the expected delivery date, related queries had decreased by 7%.

## Test 7: Weekly Top Author Automation

- An autoplay system was introduced to boost the clicks for authors ranked beyond the top five in the weekly top author list. 
- Out of 30 authors, page views increased for 20 (67%) compared to before.
- However, the page views for the top five authors declined because the autoplay system pushes the first five out of view as the page loads.
- In the next phase, autoplay will be delayed until users scroll down.

## Test 8: Evaluate the Effectiveness of Website Page Components (Adding Multiple Tab Style)
- **Among browse pages**:
  - Unique page views of search browse pages increased by 35%.
  - Category browse pages increased by 44%.
  - Author browse pages increased by 4%.
  - Publisher browse pages increased by 16%.
- On average, 95% of unique page views come from the first tab on category, author, and publisher browse pages.
- Unique page views of feature lists on browse pages account for 6% of total unique browse page views.
- **Of these**:
  - 78% come from category feature lists.
  - 2% from author feature lists.
  - 20% from publisher feature lists.
- Almost 91% of page views in feature lists come from the top five positions (category and publisher).
- **Page view distribution across browse pages**:
  - Category browse: 95.06% of views happen on the first five pages, with 70.60% on the first page.
  - Author browse: 98.92% of views occur in the first five pages, with 89.18% on the first page.
  - Publisher browse: 95.63% of views occur in the first five pages, with 66.19% on the first page.
  - Search browse: 99.08% of views occur in the first five pages, with 91.24% on the first page.
- Data was based on observations from August 30th to October 31st.

## Test 9: Elimination of Checkout Process Buttons
- Unnecessary options were removed from the cart, shipping, and payment pages to reduce customer distractions.
- These removed options include subscription, payment icons, view details, change address, continue shopping, back button, and search option on the shipping page.
- **As a result**:
  - Conversion from cart to shipping increased by 6% (for those arriving from detail pages) and 4% (for those arriving from the home or browse pages).
  - Conversion from shipping to payment decreased by 4% (for those arriving from the home or browse pages).
- There was no significant change in conversion for other sections.
- Additional data collection was needed to clarify the trends.

## Test 10: Sign Up Form Modification (2 Options Removed)
- Two options, "Gender" and "Birthdate," were removed from the sign-up form to observe any changes in sign-up rates.
- This led to a 0.23% increase in sign-ups compared to the previous month, and the highest number of sign-ups in the last six months.
- However, the biggest barrier in the sign-up form was the CAPTCHA ("I am not a robot" section).
- According to Hotjar, this was where most customers drop off. Removing CAPTCHA could significantly increase sign-ups.

## Conclusion
The tests outlined above provided valuable insights into user behavior and platform performance. Several improvements had been identified, including the need for better communication on delivery dates, more refined automation features, and adjustments to user interface components to increase engagement and conversions. Future actions based on these results would focus on optimizing user experience, driving customer satisfaction, and refining operational processes to maximize efficiency and growth.
